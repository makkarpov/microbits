microbits
=========

A project with various essential utilities for microcontroller projects (mostly targeting STM32 chips), including:

* Cryptographic library focused on small code size for components such as bootloaders
* USB stack focused on code size and ease of integration, currently supporting STM32G4 and STM32H5 families.
